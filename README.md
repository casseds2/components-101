# Components 101

This project contains some information on how clojure components work. I have made
some java code and translated it into a clojure implementation in the hopes that
it is more clear what is happening.

The reason for writing this documentation is that I myself had difficulty understanding
the intricacies of how it all tied together when I first began writing clojure.
I hope that some of what I have to say from my experiences is able to help others
in a similar boat :boat:
